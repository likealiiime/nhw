	<h1>Welcome to<br>Nationwide Home Warranty</h1>
	<h2>What is a Home Warranty?</h2>
	<p>A home warranty is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of covered home systems, components and appliances, please see terms and conditions for limitations.</p>
	<h3>Why do I need a Home Warranty?</h3>
	<p>As a homeowner, you never know when a heat or plumbing system, appliance, or garage door will break down. Repairing these systems requires time to look for a suitable repair technician, who may or may not show up, in addition to exorbitant repair costs &mdash; repairing your air conditioning system can be costly.</p>
	<p>With a contract from Nationwide Home Warranty, you can shield your wallet from necessary home repair expenses that always seem to come at the most inopportune times. For a small service fee, you can have a pre-screened, licensed local service technician repair or replace your covered broken system or appliance on your schedule. Our network boasts a 15,000 strong workforce of licensed local contractors who are ready to assist you. Please review the terms and conditions before purchasing.<p>
